#+TITLE: A simple C++ wrapper for OpenCL.

* Introduction

Basically anyone who writes OpenCL needs some kind of wrappers, here is mine.

/clloop/ is a simple C++ header only wrapper for OpenCL. It supports scalar
types, array, vector, struct and vector of structs.

* Examples
Just check out "./tests/testwrapper.cc". It's a file less than 100 lines but contains
above usage.
